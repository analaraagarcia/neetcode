## 📖 About
This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to algorithmic problems from the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) platform. The primary goal is to practice data structures and algorithms using **C++**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
I am currently learning and practicing. The solutions posted here are my initial attempts and **may not always be the most optimized** in terms of time or space complexity.

I am highly open to feedback! If you see a way to improve a solution, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
